# WWCP_ESGP


This software will allow the communication between World Wide Charging Protocol
(WWCP) entities and entities implementing the *E-Mobility Statistics Gathering Protocol (ESGP)*.
The focus of this protocol are the communication aspects between charge point operators (CPOs)
and national contact points (NCPs) in e-mobility.


### Scope

This implementation aims to become one of the ESGP reference implementations. Therefore you will find a lot of inline documentation, many test cases and mockups.
